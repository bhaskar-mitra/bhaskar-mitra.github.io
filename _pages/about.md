I am an information retrieval researcher based in Montreal, Canada.
I design machine learning models and systems for information access, develop evaluation methodologies and benchmarks, and study the sociotechnical implications of information access platforms.
I am currently serving as the [ACM SIGIR Secretary](https://sigir.org/general-information/officers-and-volunteers) and as an [Associate Editor](https://dl.acm.org/journal/tois/editorial-board) for the ACM Transactions on Information System (TOIS) journal.
I previously served as the ACM SIGIR Community Relations Coordinator (2022-2025).
I have received several awards for my research, including two [ACM SIGIR Early Career Researcher Awards](https://sigir.org/awards/sigir-ecr-awards/) (2024) for excellence in research and in community engagement.
I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science from University College London under the supervision of [Dr. Emine Yilmaz](https://sites.google.com/site/emineyilmaz/).
