After spending almost two decades in big tech, I was notified last month that I am being laid off.
There have been [massive waves of layoffs](https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/15/tech-layoffs-2025-list/) across the industry recently, and I am just one of the many tens of thousands of tech workers who have been impacted.
However, the news marked a moment of much bigger personal change for me as it prompted me to finally gather up enough courage to make a decision that I have been putting off for years.
I am leaving big tech.

I will no longer be pursuing any job opportunities in big tech or typical silicon-valley-type startups.
This is not a decision that I am making lightly.
In fact, the intention to leave big tech has been constantly on my mind for the last several years.
I debated a lot about how openly I want to talk about my decision and finally convinced myself that it is important that I do.
Conversations with friends, colleagues, and collaborators over the years have led me to believe that I am not alone in wrestling with this decision, and if that’s you then I want you to know that I see you and if you need someone to talk to then please feel free to reach out.

_Why am I leaving big tech?_ There are several reasons.
While I list a few individually below, I believe they are the consequences of the same underlying structural problem: an unprecedented concentration of power in the hands of those in big tech who want to deliberately enact (or, at the very least, are incapable of imagining anything besides) a techno-fascist future.
I believe that is the root cause for the momentous cultural and material changes that we are collectively witnessing sweeping across the industry.

**The genocide that no one is allowed to talk about.** &nbsp;According to a [United Nations (UN) Special Committee](https://archive.ph/20250410202716/https://www.un.org/unispal/document/un-special-committee-press-release-19nov24/), [Amnesty International](https://amnesty.ca/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Amnesty-International-Gaza-Genocide-Report-December-4-2024.pdf), [Médecins Sans Frontières](https://msf.org.uk/issues/gaza-genocide), and many other experts, Israel is committing [genocide in Gaza]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_genocide) against the Palestinian people. By April 2025, the Gaza Health Ministry had reported that [more than fifty thousand people in Gaza had been killed](https://www.ochaopt.org/content/reported-impact-snapshot-gaza-strip-3-april-2025)—i.e., 1 out of every 44 people at an average of 93 deaths per day. These deaths are a result of [mass bombings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_bombing_of_the_Gaza_Strip), [use of starvation as a weapon of war](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2025/07/gaza-evidence-points-to-israels-continued-use-of-starvation-to-inflict-genocide-against-palestinians/), [destruction of civilian infrastructure](https://www.hindrajabfoundation.org/news/targeting-life-itself-israels-systematic-destruction-of-civilian-infrastructure-in-gaza), attacks on [healthcare workers](https://www.msf.org/strikes-raids-and-incursions-year-relentless-attacks-healthcare-palestine) and [aid-seekers]( https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2025-06-27/ty-article-magazine/.premium/idf-soldiers-ordered-to-shoot-deliberately-at-unarmed-gazans-waiting-for-humanitarian-aid/00000197-ad8e-de01-a39f-ffbe33780000), and [forced displacement](https://www.hrw.org/report/2024/11/14/hopeless-starving-and-besieged/israels-forced-displacement-palestinians-gaza). Big tech giants have not only played a [pivotal role]( https://www.accessnow.org/gaza-genocide-big-tech/) in materially supporting and profiting from this ongoing genocide over the last two and half years (see [UN report](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/7/1/un-report-lists-companies-complicit-in-israels-genocide-who-are-they)), but have also [ruthlessly silenced](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2025/05/16/silicon-valley-workers-dissent-employment-layoffs-whistleblowers/) any dissenting voices among its employees.

In my early years in the tech industry, I learned about the [infamous history](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_and_the_Holocaust) of how IBM, the big tech institution of the day, had provided key technological support for the Holocaust, committed by Nazi Germany against Jewish people. How naïve I was then to wonder how that could have ever come to pass, and never did I in my wildest nightmare imagine that it would be the dominant story of tech of our generation.

**When hype _is_ the product**  &nbsp;A decade ago, as I was just starting out on my PhD journey in the field of information retrieval (IR), I was part of an early cohort of IR researchers who saw big potential in deep learning methods for IR tasks. I co-organized the [first neural IR workshop at SIGIR](https://bhaskar-mitra.github.io/showpdf/?file=3053408.3053425) and went on to co-author [a book](https://www.nowpublishers.com/article/Details/INR-061) on the topic, co-develop the [MS MARCO benchmark](http://msmarco.org/), and co-found the [TREC Deep Learning Track](https://microsoft.github.io/msmarco/TREC-Deep-Learning). Last year, I was awarded the ACM SIGIR Early Career Researcher Award for my research on neural IR. I say these, not to brag, but as evidence of the genuine excitement I have felt over the years about the progress in the field of machine learning that I have both witnessed and in my own capacity contributed towards. But I am deeply disconcerted by the monstrous shape that AI hype has taken today.

The hype itself is not a new phenomenon. Even as I was starting out in the field, I did not much care for the sudden rebranding of neural networks into “deep learning”. In fact, in many of my early works I continued to use the phrase “neural IR” (cheekily, shortening it to “neu-ir” to sound like “new IR”) over “deep learning for IR” and other such monikers. But the hype around “AI” has taken a much more menacing turn. It has turned into a [religious cult-ish phenomenon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ovuMoW2EGk), that is uncompromising in its opposition to any rational critique or discourse. Tech companies are mandating that every team insert large language models (LLMs) in every possible product feature, and even in their own daily workflows. Whether or not that has a positive or negative impact is completely besides the point. Why? Because the evidence-free promises of AI utopia that tech “leaders” are so boldly prophesizing makes stocks go brrrrrrrrr…. No, “AI” will not be a “new digital species”, nor will it be a wand that magically solves climate change or any of our social problems. But the grand fictitious narratives about AI, both the hype and the fearmongering, will continue to bolster claims of their “foundational” advancements resulting in potentially the biggest accumulation of power and wealth in the hands of a few in our lifetimes. That _is_ the intent and why AI is largely a fascist neocolonial project.

As an IR researcher, I am particularly [concerned](https://bhaskar-mitra.github.io/showpdf/?file=978-3-031-73147-1_7) by the uncritical adoption of these technologies in information access. I am concerned about how institutions with access to treasure troves of people’s behavioral data combined with the capabilities of generative AI to produce persuasive language and imagery will produce tools of mass manipulation of public opinion, both in context of conversational information access and in particular generative ads. Even if one were to assume best intentions on the parts of these institutions (you really shouldn’t!), the existence of such capabilities incentivizes authoritarian capture of these information access platforms.

**The co-optation of Responsible AI** &nbsp;I have incredible respect for those in the industry who are doing critical work on Responsible AI / AI & society. However, I am also tremendously concerned by the shrinking power of those critical voices. Those who do that work, do that under incredible stress and [risks to their own careers](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/03/30/tech-companies-cut-ai-ethics/). The boundaries of what you are allowed to critique is shrinking rapidly. You are allowed (for now) to get on a pulpit and talk about fairness and representational harms (don’t get me wrong, those are very important too!) _as long as_ it paints the institutions as “responsible corporations trying to do the right thing for society for which they should receive accolades” but never to critique the institution and definitely never if it conflicts with profit. The bad actors in your threat models must always be out there, never the institutions (i.e., the platform owners). Never critique the concentration of wealth and power in the hands of these platforms. And definitely definitely never talk about the [military-AI complex](https://www.techpolicy.press/booming-military-spending-on-ai-is-a-windfall-for-tech-and-a-blow-to-democracy/).

The ultimate outcome of this is the securitization of “Responsible AI” which manifests today as the “AI safety” framing that selectively strips away any concerns of social justice from the agenda. If Responsible AI / IR is framed to not challenge war, colonial extractive practices, racial capitalism, gender and sexual injustices, and other forms of oppression, then what are we even trying to do?

**What’s next?** &nbsp;I don’t want to sound blasé but getting laid off may have been the best thing to happen to me this year. I don’t want to minimize how difficult it is to be on the receiving end of that news, and I am quite aware of my own privileges for having a permanent residence status in Canada and sufficient financial stability for the short term. I don’t wish this on anyone, and my heart goes out to everyone who have been impacted. But in a strange way, this sincerely feels like a blessing in disguise. It took me a while to acknowledge this but every passing day since I got the news of the layoff, I have felt more excited about the future.

I want to take this opportunity to explore spaces where I can do research grounded explicitly in humanistic anti-fascist anti-capitalist values and find community with like-minded people to do that work with. I want to spend more time [reading](https://bhaskar-mitra.github.io/reading/) and learning. I want to spend more time in movement spaces. I want to [reimagine](https://bhaskar-mitra.github.io/showpdf/?file=19654_Mitra) very different futures for how we collectively experience information. I want to work on [emancipatory information access](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wK-nHCg_ZHg) and ground my research in revolutionary praxis. I want to build technology that humanizes us, that connects us, that liberates us, that gives us joy.
